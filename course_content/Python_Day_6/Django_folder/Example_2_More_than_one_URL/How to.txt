replace the code of "urls.py" of "firstapp" with the following code:

so , your "urls.py" inside "firstapp" should look like

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',views.home,name='home page'),
    path('Special',views.special,name='special page')
]

the meaning of above entries is:
	 path('',views.home,name='home page')
on home page visit, i.e. http://localhost:8000
	"home" function of "views.py" should be called

	path('Special',views.special,name='special page')

if we say,
	http://localhost:8000/Special
		"special" function of "views.py" should be called.


let's go to "views.py" and define "home" and "special" functions

so your "view.py" should look like:


from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to first Django app")

def special(request):
    return HttpResponse("<b><u><i>Welcome to Special page</b></u></i>")



now project "myproject" within which we have "firstapp", should know that we've created urls.

so open "urls.py" of "myproject" and make changes

so "urls.py" of "myproject" should look like:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('firstapp.urls'))
]

it's like request for anything other than "admin",
		visit "urls.py" of "firstapp"


now start the server

on terminal type the following command:

python manage.py runserver

make sure you get following message:

	Django version 4.2, using settings 'myproject.settings'

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


click this link and make sure you get following message in the browser:

	Welcome to first Django app

now type following inside the browser

http://127.0.0.1:8000/Special

and make sure u get following message:

	Welcome to Special page
