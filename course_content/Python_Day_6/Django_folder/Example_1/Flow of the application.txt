After starting the server , when you hit following url on the browser

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

control goes to

	"urls.py"  of myproject

where it is written
	
	path('',include('firstapp.urls'))

The entry path('', include('firstapp.urls')) means that all requests that don't match the /admin/ path will be directed to firstapp/urls.py

so 
	path('',include('firstapp.urls'))

means that go to "urls.py" of "firstapp"

inside "urls.py" of "firstapp", following entry is written

	path('',views.home,name='home page')

it means on the home page visit (' '), go to "views.py" and invoke "home" function by passing "request" object

now control goes to "home" function of "views.py" and execute the code which is written inside it , which gives us response on the browser page.
