your project location should be inside 

	C:\Users\Nitin\PycharmProjects



main location of "site-packages" where all libraries are by default downloaded is:


"C:\Users\Nitin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages"


if you have installed a package and still you get package not found error, always select "existing" as an option and select interpreter from 

"C:\Users\Sriram\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe"

How to create virtual environment?

pip install virtualenv

[ virtualenv is used to manage Python packages for different projects. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could break system tools or other projects.]



pip install virtualenv



if you want to create a virtual environment , go to your project location on the terminal and type:

C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects> python -m venv myenv
		or
 py -m venv myenv

	or
 python3 -m venv myenv


	this command will create "myenv" folder inside "C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects"
	inside "myenv" folder you will get
		"Lib\site-packages"
	this "site-packages" is the folder where your environment (myenv) specific packages only will be stored. 
i.e. [C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects\myenv\Lib\site-packages]

so, the "site-packages" folder which is available to all the projects
	i.e.
	C:\Users\nitin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages

is different and "site-packages" which is specific to a particular virtual environment  i.e.
	C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects\myenv\Lib\site-packages



if you want to list out the packages installed for your project, go to your project folder on the terminal and give following command

C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects>pip list

it will list out all the packages which have been installed globally.


now if you want to activate your virtual environment, give following command

C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects> cd myenv
it will change to 
C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects\myenv>

now give command
C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects\myenv> Scripts\activate

make sure command prompt changes to :

(myenv) C:\Users\nitin\PycharmProjects\myenv>
	this means that we've activated "myenv" virtual environment

now list out how many packages have been installed inside your virtual environment (myenv)

(myenv) C:\Users\Sriram\PycharmProjects\myenv> pip list

to deactivate the virtual environment give command
	deactivate
