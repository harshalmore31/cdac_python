In order to connect to a particular database, we need a driver software for that database. That driver we get through a particular software

e.g. in order to connect to MySQL
		pip install mysql-connector-driver

	in order to connect to Oracle
		pip install oracledb

	in order to connect to SQL Server
		pip install pyodbc


The API to communicate with the database remains same i.e. connect() , cursor, execute(),executeMany(), fetchAll, callProc() etc.
